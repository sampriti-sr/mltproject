## Machine Learning Technique Project
This Kaggle competition is based on a dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. We had to build a model with accuracy >= 0.75.
The main problem faced while developing the model was the imbalanced dataset but this was balanced by SMOTE.
